## Overview

A simple to-do list application to demonstrate my React knowledge.

Front-end project only, no backend or database storage.

The application can be tested [HERE](https://easyvansh.github.io/To-Do-List/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and `cd` into its root directory
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` from the project directory to run in development mode

The application is served at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default.

## Building

Run `npm run build` to build the static assets for external or local hosting. The files will be located inside the `build` folder by default.

This correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.


## Usage

Write task descriptions in the text field and press `Enter` to add them to the list. You can also click on the icon inside the text field to add the task.
